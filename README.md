```
The basic browser should be running at localhost:8000. To upload track and data into the Basic Browser, a new TTY terminal must be opened in the container.
```sh
docker exec -ti basic-browser bash
```

## Create a username and password through the terminal the first time
```sh
cd /opt/basic/
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

## About Data persistence

```

```sh
docker restart basic-browser
```
